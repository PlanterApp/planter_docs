**Multi-select** lets you edit multiple garden squares or plants at once.
<br />Use **multi-select** to remove plants, add notes and events, or customize backgrounds.
{{< alert icon="🥕" context="info" text="You can't use multi-select to shift plants around or add multiple plants. Use [**quick plant**](../../plants/add-plants) to add multiples of the same type of plant." />}}

{{< alert icon="💸" context="info" text="Notes and events and custom backgrounds are [**Premium features**](../../account/premium-subscription)" />}}

1. Select the **multi-select icon** {{< mdi select-group "Multi-select icon ">}} <br /><br />
