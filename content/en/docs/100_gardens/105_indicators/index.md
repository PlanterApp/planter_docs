Helpful garden indicators in Planter let you plan and manage your garden at a glance!

#### Compatibility indicators
Compatibility indicators are the green and red circles (and quarter-circles) that sometimes appear between plants in your garden.

{{< screenshot Compatibility-indicators.jpg "Screenshot of a garden with green, red, and yellow compatibility indicators" >}} <br /><br />
- **Green circles** between plants means they are companions and may benefit each other when planted together
- **Red circles** between plants means they are combative and may compete or share pests and diseases
- **No circle** between plants means they are neutral - neither companions nor combative
{{< alert icon="🍅" context="info" text="Red circles have a darker inner circle to help color-blind gardeners identify them" />}}

To toggle compatibility indicators on or off select the  **three dots icon ⋮** then select **Show companion info**<br /><br />

#### Plant spacing indicators
Planter indicates how many plants should be planted per-square-foot by showing a number with an **X** and a white circle around it:<br /><br />
{{< screenshot Spacing-indicators.jpg "Screenshot of a garden with plant spacing indicators" >}}<br /><br />
- **4x** means 4 plants can be planted within one square foot of garden space
- Plants that need a square foot of space or more per plant do not have a spacing indicator - the size of the plant icon in the garden shows how many square feet the plant needs
{{< alert icon="🌱" context="info" text="If you change Planter to [**metric units**](../../getting-started/set-units) plant spacings remain the same. Planter indicates how many plants can be planted per square foot (roughly 1/10m²)." />}}

#### Notes and events indicators
If you added a note or an event to a plant in your garden, a **notes and events indicator** {{< mdi note-multiple "The garden Notes and Events icon" >}} will appear on that plant:<br /><br />
{{< screenshot Notes-indicators.jpg "Screenshot of a garden with notes indicators on plants" >}}<br /><br />
{{< alert icon="💸" context="info" text="Notes and events are [**Premium features**](../../account/premium-subscription)" />}}

To toggle notes and events indicators on or off select the  **three dots icon ⋮** then select **Show notes**<br /><br />
