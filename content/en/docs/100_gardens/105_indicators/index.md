Helpful garden indicators in Planter let you plan and manage your garden at a glance!

#### Compatibility indicators
Compatibility indicators are the green, red, and yellow circles (and quarter-circles) that sometimes appear between plants in your garden.

{{< screenshot Compatibility-indicators.jpg "Screenshot of a garden with green, red, and yellow compatibility indicators" >}} <br /><br />
- **Green circles** between plants means they are companions and work well planted next to each other
- **Red circles** between plants means they are combative and shouldn't be planted next to each other
- **Yellow circles** mean that some varieties of the plants are companions while others are combative
- **No circle** between plants means they are neutral - neither companions nor combative
{{< alert icon="🍅" context="info" text="Red circles have a darker inner circle to help color-blind gardeners identify them" />}}
{{< alert icon="🥕" context="info" text="If you see a yellow circle, you may want to research whether the varieties you plan to plant side-by-side are compatible" />}}

#### Plant Spacing indicators
Planter indicates how many plants should be planted per-square-foot by showing a number with an **X** and a white circle around it:<br /><br />
{{< screenshot Spacing-indicators.jpg "Screenshot of a garden with plant spacing indicators" >}}<br /><br />
- **4x** means 4 plants can be planted within one square foot of garden space
- Plants that need a square foot of space or more per plant do not have a spacing indicator - the size of the plant in the garden shows how many square feet the plant needs
{{< alert icon="🌱" context="info" text="If you change the units in Planter to metric, plant spacings remain the same. Planter indicates how many plants can be planted in roughly 1/10m²." />}}

#### Notes and Events indicators
If you added a note or an event to a plant in your garden, a **Notes and Events indicator**{{< screenshot Notes-and-events-icon.jpg "Screenshot of the garden Notes and Events icon" >}} will appear on that plant:<br /><br />
