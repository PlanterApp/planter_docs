- **Spacing:** how many plants fit within a square foot. The plant spacing per square foot can be customized by selecting this card.

- **Depth:** how deep to plant the seeds (not transplants). For plants that aren't typically grown from seed, the Depth card does not appear.

- **Sun:** whether the plant prefers a **Full Sun** location (6 or more hours of sunlight per day), a **Part Sun** location (4-6 hours of sunlight per day), a **Full-Part Sun** location (4 or more hours of sunlight per day) or a location in the **Shade** (less than 4 hours of sunlight per day)

- **Water:** how much water the plant needs in total per week. This can come from rainfall or supplemental watering. If the plant doesn't typically need watering once it matures, the **Water** card won't appear.

- **Season:** whether the plant is a **Warm** season crop that grows best when daytime temperatures are above 70°F (21°C), a **Cool** season crop that stops producing when daytime temperatures reach 80°F (27°C), or a **Perennial** that comes back each year, so long as it's hardy enough to withstand the local winter conditions

- **Frost:** whether the plant is **Tolerant** of hard frosts with air temperatures are below 28°F (-2°C), **Semi-Tolerant** of light frosts with air temperatures are between 28°F and 32°F (-2°C and 0°C), or **Not Tolerant** of frost where any frost might kill the plant

- **Germination:** how many days or weeks it takes the seeds to germinate (sprout) under proper germination conditions

- **Sprout to Harvest:** once the plant has sprouted, how many days it takes for the plant to start producing or to be ready for harvesting

{{< alert icon="🍅" context="info" text="Tomatoes don't have Sprout to Harvest days noted, because it varies significantly depending on the variety!" />}}

#### Growing Calendar
Shows when to **Start Inside** (start growing seeds indoors), when to **Transplant** (plant already-growing plants outdoors), and when to **Start Outside** (plant seeds directly outdoors), based on your [**frost date settings**](../../getting-started/frost-dates)

{{< alert icon="🌴" context="info" text="If you don't have frost or freezing temperatures in your area, ignore the Growing Calendar dates. Plant cool season crops in your cooler season and plant heat-loving crops in your warmer season." />}}

- If the plant is typically grown by planting seeds directly outdoors, only the **Start Inside** dates will show

- If the plant is typically grown by starting seeds indoors then transplanting outside, only the **Start Inside** and **Transplant** dates will show. <br /><br />
