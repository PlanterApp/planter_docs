Use the **Growing Calendar** in Planter to time your garden plantings!

Check which plants you can **Start Inside**, **Transplant**, or **Sow Outside** at any point in your local growing season.

{{< alert icon="🌶️" context="warning" text="Be sure to **set your frost dates** so the Growing Calendar will show the correct timings for your area." />}}
{{< alert icon="🌴" context="info" text="If you don't have frost or freezing temperatures in your area, ignore the Growing Calendar dates. Plant cool season crops in your cooler season and plant heat-loving crops in your warmer season." />}}

1. Select **Calendar** from the menu bar<br /><br />

3. **Filter**{{< screenshot Filter-icon.jpg "Screenshot of the filter icon" >}} to narrow the list of plants:<br />
- Select whether you want to **Show All** plants, see only your **Favorite plants** or see only the plants you have planned to plant **In Your Garden**<br /><br />
- Select whether you want to see plants that you can **Start inside now**, **Transplant now**, or **Sow outside now** (select all three to see all at once, or leave them unselected to the growing calendar for all plants)<br /><br />
