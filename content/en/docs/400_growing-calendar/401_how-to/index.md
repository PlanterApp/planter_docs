Use the **Growing Calendar** in Planter to time your garden plantings!

Check which plants you can **Start Inside**, **Transplant**, or **Sow Outside** at any point in your local growing season.

{{< alert icon="🌶️" context="warning" text="Be sure to [**set your frost dates**](../../getting-started/frost-dates) so the Growing Calendar will show the correct timings for your area" />}}
{{< alert icon="🌴" context="info" text="If you don't have frost or freezing temperatures in your area, ignore the **Growing Calendar** dates. View our Growing Guide about [**Growing Veggies in Subtropical and Tropical Climates**](https://blog.planter.garden/posts/growing-veggies-in-subtropical-and-tropical-climates/)" />}}

1. Select **Calendar** from the menu bar<br /><br />

3. **Filter** {{< mdi filter "Filter icon" >}} to narrow the list of plants:<br />
- Select whether you want to **Show All** plants, see only your **Favorite plants** or see only the plants you have planned to plant **In Your Garden**<br /><br />
- Select whether you want to see plants that you can **Start inside now**, **Transplant now**, or **Sow outside now** (select all three to see all at once, or leave them unselected to the growing calendar for all plants)<br /><br />
