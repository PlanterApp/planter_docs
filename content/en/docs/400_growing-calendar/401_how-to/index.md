Use the **Growing Calendar** in Planter to time your garden plantings!

Check which plants you can **Start Inside**, **Transplant**, or **Sow Outside** at any point in your local growing season.

{{< alert icon="🌶️" context="warning" text="Be sure to **set your frost dates** so the Growing Calendar will show the correct timings for your area." />}}
{{< alert icon="🌴" context="info" text="If you don't have frost or freezing temperatures in your area, ignore the Growing Calendar dates. Plant cool season crops in your cooler season and plant heat-loving crops in your warmer season." />}}

1. Select **Calendar** from the menu bar<br /><br />

 icon to change the sorting<br /><br />

3. Select the **Filter** icon to narrow the list of plants:<br /><br />
- Select whether you want to **Show All** plants, see only your **Favorite plants** or see only the plants you have planned to plant **In Your Garden**<br /><br />
- Select whether you want to see plants that you can **Start inside now**, **Transplant now**, or **Sow outside now** (select all three to see All of these actions, or leave all three unselected to the growing calendar for all plants regardless of whether you can plant them now)<br /><br />

{{< screenshot Calendar_filtered.jpg "Screenshot of the growing calendar filtered for Transplant now and Sow outside now" >}}

{{< alert icon="🍐" context="info" text="These filter settings work together- if you select **Favorite plants** and **Start Inside now**, you will see which of your favorite plants can be started inside now." />}}

4. Search to find the **Growing Calendar** for a specific plant<br /><br />
{{< screenshot Calendar-search.jpg "Screenshot of searching for the growing calendar for raspberries" >}}
{{< alert icon="🌶️" context="warning" text="Any filters that are applied will also filter the search results. Select **Show all** and de-select **Start inside now, Transplant now, and Sow outside now** to see all search results." />}}
