Use the **Growing Calendar** in Planter to see which plants you can **Start Inside**, **Transplant**, or **Sow Outside** at any point in your local growing season.

{{< alert icon="🌶️" context="warning" text="Be sure to [**set your frost dates**](../../getting-started/frost-dates) so the Growing Calendar will show accurate information for your area" />}}
{{< alert icon="🌴" context="info" text="If you don't have frost or freezing temperatures in your area, ignore the **Growing Calendar** dates. Plant cool season crops in your cooler season and plant heat-loving crops in your warmer season." />}}

#### Use the growing calendar
1. Select **Calendar** from the menu bar<br /><br />

{{< screenshot Calendar-sort.jpg "Screenshot of growing calendar sorting options" >}}<br /><br />

3. **Filter** {{< mdi filter "Filter icon" >}} to narrow the list of plants<br />
- Select whether you want to **Show all** plants, see only your **Favorite plants** or see only the plants **In my gardens**<br /><br />
- Select whether you want to see plants that you can **Start inside now**, **Transplant now**, or **Sow outside now** (select all three to see all at once, or leave them unselected to the growing calendar for all plants)<br /><br />

{{< screenshot Calendar_filtered.jpg "Screenshot of the growing calendar filtered for Transplant now and Sow outside now" >}}<br /><br />

4. Search to find the **Growing Calendar** for a specific plant<br /><br />
{{< screenshot Calendar-search.jpg "Screenshot of searching for the growing calendar for raspberries" >}}
{{< alert icon="🌶️" context="warning" text="Filters also apply to search results. Select **Show all** and de-select **Start inside now, Transplant now, and Sow outside now** to see all search results." />}}

#### Interpret the growing calendar

- The solid black line indicates the current date
- The blue areas show the time after your first frost date in fall and your last frost date in spring
- The white area shows the time between your last frost date in spring and your first frost date in fall
- The pink, yellow, and purple bars indicate when you can start seeds indoors, transplant plants outdoors, and sow seeds outdoors
  - If the plant is typically grown by planting seeds directly outdoors, only the **Start Outside** dates will show
  - If the plant is typically grown by starting seeds indoors then transplanting outside, only the **Start Inside** and **Transplant** dates will show
  - Darker shaded areas indicate the typical timing for sowing seeds and transplanting
  - Lighter shaded areas indicate times you may be able to sow seeds or transplant but the plants might need protection from the weather
