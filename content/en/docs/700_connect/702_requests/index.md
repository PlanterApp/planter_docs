Have a feature request, or new plant or variety request?

Use the [**feature requests tool**](https://planter.garden/requests) to request new features and plants.

- Check the **request list** before logging a new request, to see if the same request has already been logged by someone else.
- Upvote existing requests to have them prioritized sooner.

Looking to send general feedback rather than logging a request? Use the **Send feedback** option in **Settings** to contact the Planter team:
1. Select **Settings** from the menu bar<br /><br />

2. Scroll down and select **Send feedback** (under the **Info** section)
<br /><br />

3. Draft an email to the Planter team (be sure to note the email address that you use for your Planter account)
