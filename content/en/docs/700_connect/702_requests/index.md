Have a feature request, or new plant or variety request?

Use the feature requests tool to request new features and plants.

Check the request list before logging a new request, to see if the same request has already been logged by someone else. Upvote existing requests to have them prioritized sooner.

Looking to send general feedback rather than logging a request? Use the **Send feedback** option in **Settings* to email the Planter team directly.
