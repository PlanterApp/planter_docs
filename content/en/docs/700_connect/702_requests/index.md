Have a feature request, or new plant or variety request?

Use the **feature requests tool** to request new features and plants.

- Check the **request list** before logging a new request, to see if the same request has already been logged by someone else. Upvote existing requests to have them prioritized sooner.

- Looking to send general feedback rather than logging a request? Use the **Send feedback** option in **Settings** to contact the Planter team.
