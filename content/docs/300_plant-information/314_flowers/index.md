In March 2024, we expanded the flower options in Planter to include several cut flowers!

We are continuing to add new flowers to Planter and will gradually expand into landscaping plants.

To request new flowers and plants (and to upvote existing requests) [check out the Plant and Feature Request List](https://planter.garden/requests).
