## Frost Tasks
Frost tasks remind you when your frost dates are coming so you can protect your plants in the fall or get ready to plant in spring! We'll remind you 2 weeks before your frost dates. Simply [**set your frost dates**](../../getting-started/frost-dates/) to get these reminders.

## Plant Tasks
 Plant tasks are a great way to keep track of when to start seeds, transplant, or harvest plants.

### Add individual plant tasks
{{< alert icon="🍎" context="info" text="Tasks are pre-loaded for plants in existing garden plans. New tasks are also automatically added as you add plants to your plans. You should only need to add tasks for plants not in your plans, or if you've removed a task in error." />}}

1. Select **More** from the menu bar then select **Tasks**<br /><br />
