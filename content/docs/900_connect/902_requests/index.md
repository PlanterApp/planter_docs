Have a feature request, or new plant or variety request?

Use the [**feature requests tool**](https://planter.garden/requests) to request new features and plants.

- Check the **request list** before logging a new request, to see if the same request has already been logged by someone else
- Upvote existing requests to have them prioritized sooner

Looking to share general feedback rather than logging a specific request? Use the [**Send feedback**](../contact-us/#send-feedback-contact-support) option in **Settings** to contact the Planter team.
