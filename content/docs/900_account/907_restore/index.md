If that doesn't work, try the following:
- If you just subscribed and premium features aren't working, try closing and reopening the app.
- If this is your first time using Planter on a new device, [**login to migrate your data**](../migrate-restore/) (and subscription) to your new device.
- Check the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/account/subscriptions) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/account/subscriptions) to ensure your subscription is still active (not applicable for Lifetime Subscriptions). Sometimes expired credit cards can interrupt a subscription.

{{< alert icon="🥦" context="info" text="If you’re having trouble restoring your subscription please use the [**Send feedback**](../../connect/contact-us/#send-feedback-contact-support) option in **Settings** to email the Planter team. Include your order receipt (if you have it) and the email address for your Planter Premium account." />}}
